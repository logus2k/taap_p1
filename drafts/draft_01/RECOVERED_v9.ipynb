    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have become a fundamental class of generative models for learning complex data distributions and synthesizing realistic samples. In the classical (unconditional) GAN framework, the generator receives only random noise as input and learns to produce samples that resemble the training data, while the discriminator learns to distinguish real data from generated samples. Although this setting allows the model to generate realistic images, it provides no control over the semantic content of the generated samples. In the context of datasets with labeled structure, such as MNIST, an unconditional GAN may generate any digit between 0 and 9, but the user cannot specify which digit should be produced.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs) extend the original GAN formulation by incorporating additional side information, such as class labels, into both the generator and the discriminator. By conditioning the generation process on a label 𝑦, the generator learns a mapping 𝐺(𝑧,𝑦) that aims to produce samples consistent with the desired class, while the discriminator is trained to assess not only whether an image is real or fake, but also whether it matches the provided condition. This conditioning mechanism enables controlled generation and significantly increases the practical usefulness of GANs in applications where semantic attributes matter, such as digit synthesis, object class control, and, more generally, text-to-image generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we investigate the implementation and behavior of conditional GANs on the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits. Starting from an unconditional DCGAN baseline, we progressively introduce conditioning mechanisms that allow explicit control over the generated digit class. Beyond basic conditioning via concatenation of labels, we explore stabilization strategies inspired by the literature, such as Spectral Normalization applied to the discriminator, in order to mitigate training instabilities and mode collapse. The experimental analysis focuses on both qualitative and quantitative aspects, including visual inspection of generated samples, class-conditional control checks, intra-class diversity, and discriminator behavior during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main objective of this work is to demonstrate that conditional adversarial training enables controllable image generation, to analyze the limitations of simple conditioning strategies, and to assess how architectural and training refinements improve stability, diversity, and label consistency. This study provides practical insights into the challenges of training cGANs and highlights the importance of appropriate conditioning and regularization techniques for achieving reliable class-conditional generation."

    "## 2.2 Setup and Training Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "This project adopts a systematic experimental design to analyze the behavior and stability of conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs) on the MNIST dataset. Beyond implementing a single adversarial formulation, multiple loss strategies are benchmarked, including the standard binary cross-entropy (BCE) loss, Least Squares GAN (LSGAN), hinge loss, and Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP). This design choice follows the theoretical and empirical insights discussed in the lecture materials on GAN losses and training stability, which highlight that different adversarial objectives lead to substantially different optimization dynamics, convergence behavior, and robustness to mode collapse. In particular, WGAN-GP is included due to its smoother loss landscape and explicit enforcement of the Lipschitz constraint, which is known to improve training stability compared to classical GAN formulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Training is performed using the Two Time-Scale Update Rule (TTUR), where the discriminator is updated with a learning rate four times higher than the generator (LR_D = 4×10⁻⁴, LR_G = 1×10⁻⁴). This choice is directly motivated by best practices discussed in the GAN training “recipe” guidelines, which emphasize that an overly weak discriminator fails to provide informative gradients to the generator, while an overly strong discriminator can lead to vanishing gradients. The Adam optimizer is used with β₁ = 0.5 and β₂ = 0.999, following the DCGAN and subsequent GAN literature, as these hyperparameters are empirically known to stabilize adversarial training by reducing excessive momentum in the discriminator updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The batch size is set to 128, representing a compromise between training stability and computational efficiency. Larger batch sizes generally provide more stable gradient estimates for both generator and discriminator, while still fitting comfortably within GPU memory constraints. The dimensionality of the latent space is fixed to 100, following common practice in DCGAN-style architectures, which provides sufficient capacity for modeling the variability of handwritten digits without introducing unnecessary complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Training is defined in terms of a fixed number of optimization steps rather than epochs. Specifically, the model is trained for 15,005 steps. This value originates from the reference Keras implementation that was converted to PyTorch and corresponds approximately to 32 epochs over the MNIST training set (MNIST contains 60,000 samples, and with a batch size of 128, one epoch corresponds to roughly 469 iterations). The step-based formulation is consistent with how GAN experiments are typically reported in the literature, as it provides finer control over the balance between generator and discriminator updates, enables predictable checkpointing and sampling intervals, and facilitates fair comparisons across different training configurations. The additional offset of five steps ensures that the final checkpoint aligns exactly with the predefined sampling interval of 1,000 steps, allowing the evolution of generated samples to be consistently monitored at fixed milestones throughout training."

    "## 3.1 GAN Loss Strategies and Benchmarking Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to systematically study the impact of different adversarial objectives on training stability and sample quality, the training pipeline was designed around a modular loss-strategy framework. Instead of hard-coding a single GAN loss, a common abstract interface was defined to encapsulate the discriminator and generator loss components, enabling multiple loss formulations to be benchmarked under identical architectural and optimization conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Four widely adopted loss strategies were implemented and evaluated:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) Loss**  \n",
    "   This strategy corresponds to the original GAN formulation, where the discriminator is trained as a probabilistic classifier distinguishing real from generated samples. The generator is optimized to maximize the probability that fake samples are classified as real. To improve training stability, label smoothing is applied to real samples, reducing overconfidence in the discriminator and mitigating sharp gradients that may destabilize the adversarial dynamics. This formulation directly reflects the classical minimax game described in the original GAN literature.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Least Squares GAN (LSGAN)**  \n",
    "   The LSGAN objective replaces the binary cross-entropy loss with a least-squares regression loss. Instead of learning to output hard binary decisions, the discriminator is encouraged to regress towards continuous target values for real and fake samples. This formulation has been shown to reduce vanishing gradients and produce smoother optimization landscapes, often resulting in more stable convergence during training. As in the BCE strategy, label smoothing is applied to the real targets to further regularize the discriminator.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Hinge Loss**  \n",
    "   The hinge loss formulation adopts a margin-based objective, where the discriminator enforces a separation between real and fake samples using a hinge function. Rather than predicting explicit probabilities, the discriminator outputs real-valued scores, and the generator is trained to maximize these scores for generated samples. This loss is commonly used in modern high-performance GAN architectures and aligns with the design patterns discussed in contemporary GAN literature, particularly in combination with architectural constraints such as spectral normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP)**  \n",
    "   The WGAN-GP strategy reformulates the adversarial game in terms of the Wasserstein distance between the real and generated data distributions. Instead of a classifier, the discriminator acts as a critic that assigns scalar scores to samples. To enforce the required Lipschitz continuity constraint, a gradient penalty term is added, penalizing deviations of the gradient norm from unity along linear interpolations between real and fake samples. Additionally, the critic is updated multiple times per generator update, following the two time-scale update principle, to ensure a sufficiently strong approximation of the Wasserstein distance during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "By implementing these loss strategies within a unified interface, the project enables a fair and controlled comparison of fundamentally different adversarial objectives. All strategies share the same generator and discriminator architectures, optimization settings, and training schedule, ensuring that observed differences in convergence behavior, stability, and sample quality can be attributed primarily to the choice of loss function rather than to confounding implementation details. This benchmarking setup reflects the theoretical and practical considerations emphasized in the course materials, where the choice of adversarial loss is a central factor in the stability and effectiveness of GAN training.\n"

    "The conditional generator was implemented using a PixelShuffle-based upsampling architecture. Class conditioning was introduced through a learned embedding of the digit label into the latent space, combined multiplicatively with the noise vector to modulate the generation process. The model first projects the conditioned latent code into a 7×7×128 feature map, then performs two stages of sub-pixel upsampling (7→14→28) using convolution + PixelShuffle blocks with Batch Normalization and ReLU activations. To reduce checkerboard and dot artifacts that can emerge from upsampling, ICNR initialization was applied to the convolutional layers preceding PixelShuffle. Finally, the generator outputs a 28×28 grayscale image through a Tanh activation, which is consistent with preprocessing that normalizes MNIST images to the range [-1, 1]."

    "The conditional discriminator was implemented using a label-map concatenation strategy, where each class label was embedded into a 28×28 spatial map and concatenated with the input image as an additional channel. The architecture consisted of two spectral-normalized convolutional blocks that progressively downsampled the input (28→14→7), followed by a spectral-normalized multilayer perceptron that produced a single authenticity score. Spectral normalization was applied to stabilize adversarial training by constraining the discriminator’s sensitivity, reducing oscillations and improving robustness to mode collapse. For benchmarking across different adversarial objectives (BCE, LSGAN, hinge, and WGAN-GP), the discriminator was configured to output raw scores (logits), allowing each loss strategy to apply its appropriate formulation without relying on a fixed sigmoid output.\n",

    "**WGAN-GP Variant (`DiscriminatorWGAN`)**: For WGAN-GP training, a separate discriminator architecture is used that removes spectral normalization and dropout, replacing them with Layer Normalization. This design addresses three key conflicts: (1) Spectral Normalization and gradient penalty are redundant Lipschitz constraints that over-regularize when combined; (2) Dropout introduces stochasticity that corrupts the gradient penalty calculation; (3) The critic capacity is increased (64→128 filters) to better approximate the Wasserstein distance. The appropriate discriminator variant is selected automatically via the `get_discriminator()` factory function based on the loss strategy."

    "Models were instantiated on the selected compute device, with the generator using its internal initialization (including ICNR initialization for PixelShuffle upsampling) and the discriminator initialized using DCGAN-style weight initialization to improve early training stability. A modular loss-strategy interface was used to select the adversarial objective (BCE, LSGAN, hinge, or WGAN-GP). For WGAN-GP, the discriminator instance was passed into the strategy object to enable computation of the gradient penalty term, enforcing the Lipschitz constraint required by the Wasserstein formulation. Training used the Two Time-Scale Update Rule (TTUR), configuring separate Adam optimizers for discriminator and generator with a higher discriminator learning rate (LR_D > LR_G) and GAN-optimized momentum parameters (β₁=0.5, β₂=0.999). This setup supports stable adversarial dynamics and enables fair benchmarking across different loss formulations under consistent optimization conditions."

    "To complement distribution-based metrics (FID/KID) and qualitative inspection, we introduced a class-consistency evaluation to explicitly measure whether the conditional generator obeys the requested label. This metric quantifies label alignment by computing the percentage of generated images whose predicted class (from an external classifier) matches the conditioning label 𝑦. This is particularly relevant for conditional GANs on MNIST because a model can produce visually plausible digits while still ignoring conditioning information (a known failure mode in cGANs).\n",

    "- *Directly targets the conditioning objective: Unlike FID/KID, this metric evaluates whether the generator respects the provided label.*\n",

    "We used the same calibrated MNIST classifier employed previously (in the project pipeline) to ensure consistency across experiments. The classifier architecture (CNN) was re-instantiated without Lightning dependencies, and the weights were loaded from a Lightning-style checkpoint (state_dict). A minor compatibility step was included to remove a potential 'model.' prefix in checkpoint keys, which commonly appears depending on how the model was saved.\n",

    "### 6.3.1 Experimental Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "All adversarial objectives (BCE, LSGAN, Hinge, and WGAN-GP) were evaluated under a controlled and identical architectural setup. In particular, the Discriminator shared the same network design across all experiments, incorporating:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Spectral Normalization (SN) applied to all convolutional and fully connected layers;\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dropout (p = 0.25) as a regularization mechanism;\n",
    "\n",
    "- Two Time-Scale Update Rule (TTUR), with the Discriminator learning rate four times larger than that of the Generator;\n",
    "\n",
    "- Conditional input via spatial concatenation of the class embedding with the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensured a fair comparison across loss strategies, while also imposing a strong regularization regime on the Discriminator.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.3.2 Sample Fidelity and Distributional Alignment (FID & KID)\n",
    "\n",
    "The quantitative evaluation using FID and KID revealed a clear ranking among the adversarial objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "- LSGAN achieved the best overall performance, with FID = 6.30 and KID = 0.0034 ± 0.0017, indicating the strongest alignment between generated and real MNIST distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- BCE followed closely, with FID = 7.74 and KID = 0.0048 ± 0.0020, confirming its role as a strong baseline for low-resolution image generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hinge loss exhibited a noticeable degradation, obtaining FID = 10.44 and KID = 0.0070 ± 0.0022, suggesting that margin-based objectives may require higher model capacity or different regularization to be competitive in this setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "- WGAN-GP performed substantially worse, with FID = 68.03 and KID = 0.0691 ± 0.0078, indicating poor distributional matching under the adopted configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "These results suggest that, for MNIST and the current cGAN architecture, least-squares objectives provide more stable and effective gradients for training than Wasserstein-based formulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.3.3 Conditional Consistency\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond visual fidelity, the conditional nature of the model was evaluated via a class-consistency metric, measuring the percentage of generated samples whose predicted class matched the conditioning label:\n",
    "\n",
    "- BCE: 97.64%\n",
    "\n",
    "- LSGAN: 97.38%\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hinge: 97.18%\n",
    "\n",
    "- WGAN-GP: 71.02%\n",
    "\n",
    "The high consistency scores obtained by BCE, LSGAN, and Hinge confirm that the conditioning mechanism is correctly learned and that the Generator reliably respects the class information. In contrast, the markedly lower consistency of WGAN-GP indicates that, in this regime, the Wasserstein objective fails to preserve class-conditional structure, leading to semantically inconsistent samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.3.4 Computational Cost\n",
    "\n",
    "The computational overhead varied significantly across strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "- BCE / LSGAN / Hinge: approximately 280–290 seconds of training time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- WGAN-GP: approximately 1,360 seconds, reflecting the additional cost of multiple critic updates per generator step (n_critic = 5) and the computation of the gradient penalty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, WGAN-GP incurred a substantially higher computational cost without corresponding gains in sample quality or conditional consistency in this experimental setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.3.5 On the Degradation of WGAN-GP under SN with Dropout\n",
    "\n",
    "The poor performance of WGAN-GP should be interpreted in light of the interaction between multiple regularization mechanisms applied simultaneously to the Discriminator:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Spectral Normalization (SN) explicitly constrains the Lipschitz constant of the Discriminator.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Gradient Penalty (GP) enforces an additional Lipschitz constraint by penalizing deviations of the gradient norm from unity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dropout introduces stochasticity into the Discriminator’s function, perturbing the smooth gradient structure assumed by the Wasserstein formulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The combination of SN + GP + Dropout can therefore lead to over-regularization of the Discriminator, limiting its capacity to provide informative gradients to the Generator. Since WGAN-GP relies critically on well-behaved and accurate gradient estimates, this mismatch degrades both visual fidelity and conditional alignment. In contrast, BCE and LSGAN objectives are less sensitive to such constraints and remain stable under strong regularization, which explains their superior empirical performance in this setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "The benchmark indicates that for conditional MNIST generation under a strongly regularized Discriminator, LSGAN offers the most favorable trade-off between fidelity, conditional consistency, and computational efficiency, with BCE remaining a competitive baseline. Although WGAN-GP is theoretically attractive for high-dimensional and complex image distributions, its direct application in this low-resolution, heavily regularized setting proved suboptimal."

    "### 6.4.1 Interpretation of Results\n",
    "\n",
    "LSGAN achieved the best overall performance, obtaining the lowest FID (6.30) and KID (0.0034), indicating the closest alignment between generated and real MNIST distributions. Compared to BCE, which achieved FID = 7.74 and KID = 0.0048, the improvement is consistent with the theoretical motivation of least-squares objectives to mitigate gradient saturation and provide smoother optimization dynamics for the Generator.\n",
    "\n",
    "BCE remained a strong baseline, producing competitive fidelity scores with only a small degradation relative to LSGAN. This confirms that the original GAN objective remains effective for low-resolution domains such as MNIST when combined with architectural stabilization techniques (Spectral Normalization, Dropout, TTUR).\n",
    "\n",
    "Hinge loss showed a clear drop in performance, with FID = 10.44 and KID = 0.0070. While hinge-based objectives are widely used in high-capacity GANs (e.g., BigGAN, SAGAN), their benefits did not translate as effectively to this lower-resolution setting and architecture, suggesting that hinge loss may require either larger model capacity or alternative regularization schemes to be competitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "WGAN-GP performed significantly worse, with FID = 68.03 and KID = 0.0691, while also being by far the most computationally expensive method (≈ 1,360 seconds vs. ≈ 280–290 seconds for the others). This indicates that, under the current configuration, the Wasserstein objective with gradient penalty fails to provide useful learning signals for conditional MNIST generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.4.2 Computational Trade-offs\n",
    "\n",
    "The training time highlights an important practical trade-off:\n",
    "\n",
    "- BCE, LSGAN, and Hinge converge in comparable time (≈ 280–290 s),\n",
    "\n",
    "- WGAN-GP is almost 5× slower, due to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. multiple critic updates per generator step (n_critic = 5),\n",
    "\n",
    "2. the cost of computing gradient penalties,\n",
    "\n",
    "3. higher memory and computational overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that WGAN-GP also produced substantially worse sample quality, it is dominated by the simpler objectives in this experimental regime."

While theoretically appealing, WGAN-GP appears mismatched with the chosen regularization stack (Spectral Normalization + Dropout) and the low-resolution MNIST domain. The interaction between gradient penalties and spectral constraints likely over-regularizes the critic, weakening the learning signal provided to the generator. This highlights that WGAN-GP is not universally superior and requires careful adaptation of architecture and hyperparameters to outperform simpler objectives.\n",

    "## 8.1 Per-Class Diversity Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Table X reports the per-class standard deviation of generated samples for each digit (0–9) under the four adversarial objectives. Higher values indicate greater intra-class diversity, i.e., a wider variety of writing styles, stroke thicknesses, and shapes within the same digit class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8.1.1 Comparison Across Loss Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Across nearly all digits, BCE and LSGAN consistently achieve the highest intra-class diversity, with very similar magnitudes. For instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Digit 0: BCE ≈ 0.673 vs. LSGAN ≈ 0.674\n",
    "\n",
    "- Digit 3: BCE ≈ 0.626 vs. LSGAN ≈ 0.602\n",
    "\n",
    "- Digit 8: BCE ≈ 0.629 vs. LSGAN ≈ 0.608\n",
    "\n",
    "This indicates that both objectives are capable of producing stylistically diverse samples within each class, rather than collapsing to a narrow prototype. The marginal advantage of BCE on some digits (e.g., 2, 3, 6, 8) is small and does not change the overall ranking.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hinge loss exhibits systematically lower diversity across most classes. While the drop is moderate, it is consistent (e.g., digit 4: 0.548 vs. BCE 0.568; digit 7: 0.550 vs. BCE 0.568), suggesting a mild tendency toward more concentrated modes. This aligns with earlier observations that hinge objectives can favor sharper but less diverse outputs when model capacity or regularization is limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "WGAN-GP displays the lowest diversity for every digit, with a substantial margin. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Digit 1: WGAN-GP ≈ 0.362 vs. BCE/LSGAN ≈ 0.473\n",
    "\n",
    "- Digit 4: WGAN-GP ≈ 0.466 vs. BCE/LSGAN ≈ 0.57\n",
    "\n",
    "- Digit 9: WGAN-GP ≈ 0.455 vs. BCE ≈ 0.577\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern indicates a pronounced mode contraction under WGAN-GP in this setup, where generated samples for each class cluster around a limited set of visual patterns. This is consistent with the previously observed degradation in FID/KID and the unstable generator dynamics for WGAN-GP.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8.1.2 Class-Specific Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "Some digits appear intrinsically easier to diversify across all objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Digits 0, 3, 6, and 8 consistently show higher diversity across BCE, LSGAN, and Hinge. These digits naturally admit multiple writing styles (loops, stroke openings, curvature), which the models successfully capture.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Digit 1 exhibits the lowest diversity across all methods, reflecting the limited stylistic variability of the digit “1” in MNIST (mostly vertical strokes with minor variations). The gap between WGAN-GP and the other methods is particularly pronounced here, indicating near-prototype collapse.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8.1.3 Interpretation and Link to Global Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "The per-class diversity trends reinforce the conclusions drawn from FID/KID and class-consistency:\n",
    "\n",
    "- LSGAN and BCE achieve a favorable balance between fidelity and diversity, producing not only realistic digits but also a wide range of styles within each class.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hinge loss trades off some diversity for sharper but more constrained generation, which may explain its weaker global FID/KID.\n",
    "\n",
    "- WGAN-GP suffers from both low fidelity and low diversity, suggesting that, under the current architecture and regularization regime (Spectral Normalization + Dropout + Gradient Penalty), the critic becomes overly constrained, leading to a weak learning signal and partial mode collapse.\n",
    "\n",
    "This per-class analysis provides important complementary evidence that the superiority of LSGAN (and the competitiveness of BCE) is not limited to global distributional metrics but extends to intra-class variability, which is crucial for conditional generation tasks. Conversely, the consistently low per-class diversity of WGAN-GP explains, at a qualitative level, its poor FID/KID scores and supports the conclusion that WGAN-GP is ill-suited to the present experimental configuration."

In contrast, WGAN-GP exhibits visibly degraded samples, with less stable digit structure and occasional artifacts, reflecting the weaker quantitative performance observed under this training configuration."

To verify that our cGAN has learned this separation, we fix a single noise vector and vary the conditioned label across all digits (0-9). If conditioning is correctly learned, the same z should produce digits that share stylistic characteristics (such as stroke thickness, slant, or size) while differing only in their identity. This visualization provides qualitative evidence that the generator uses z to control appearance and y to control semantic content."
