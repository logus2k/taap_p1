# FEMulator Pro v1.0

A containerized deployment of the Femulator Pro application. This setup allows you to run the Femulator environment with all dependencies pre-configured.

## Quick Start

The easiest way to run Femulator is using **Docker Compose**. 

### 1. Prerequisites
* Install **Docker Desktop** (Windows/Mac) or **Docker Engine** (Linux). [Get Docker here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

### 2. Create the Configuration
Create a folder on your computer and save the following content into a file named `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  femulator:
    image: logus2k/femulator:latest
    container_name: femulator
    hostname: femulator
    restart: unless-stopped
    deploy:
      resources:
        reservations:
          devices:
            - driver: nvidia
              count: "all"
              capabilities: [ gpu ]    
    logging:
      options:
        max-size: "10m"
        max-file: "3"
    ports:
      - "5868:5868"
    networks:
      - femulator_network

networks:
  femulator_network:
    driver: bridge
```

### 3. Launch the Application

Open your terminal or command prompt in that folder and run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d

```

The application will download the necessary images and start. You can now access the service via `localhost:5868`.

```

**Update to the Latest Version** To ensure you are running the most recent version of the image:

docker-compose pull
docker-compose up -d

```
